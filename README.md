# Web-Crawler-IRWS-Engine
This project is uploaded to demonstrate Information Retrieval and Web Search. This also includes a web crawler. Web crawler is currently crawling webpages that are stored offline. Project can be modified to crawl web pages online as per requirement. After crawling, this engine determines the contents of web pages and passes it to IRWS engine. IRWS engine tokenizes data, removes stop words, stems the content using Porter Stemmer Algorithm and determines the page rank using Vector space model. This Project also determines the page rank using Damping factor.
